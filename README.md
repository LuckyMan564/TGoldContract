Fees for Buy and Sell: The contract includes buyFeePercentage and sellFeePercentage, which can be adjusted to impose fees on buy and sell transactions.
Buyback and Burn: The buybackAndBurnPercentage variable is likely used to buy back and burn tokens, which helps reduce the token supply.
Reward Distribution: The contract has variables such as rewardPerTokenStored and mappings for user rewards, indicating it distributes rewards to token holders, possibly as a staking or holding incentive.
Liquidity Pool (LP) Integration: isLiquidityPool mapping and dexRouter suggest that the contract might interact with a DEX (e.g., for token swaps or liquidity provisioning).
Upgradeable Structure: It uses OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract structure, which is well-suited for implementing changes in the future.
